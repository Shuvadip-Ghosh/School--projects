// Write a Java program to overload a function calculate() as follows:

// calculate(int, int, char): returns the sum of the squares of the two int type values if their product is greater than the ascii value of the char type, else returns the sum of the cube of the two int type values.

// calculate(int, char, char): if the int type value is greater than the sum of the ascii values of the two character arguments, then return the sum of all the three arguments, otherwise return their product.

// Write a main method to create an object and call the above methods.
